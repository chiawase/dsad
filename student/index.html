    <h1>What is Depression?</h1>
    <p>Depression is a common but serious mood disorder. It causes sever symptoms that affect how you feel, think, and handle daily activities, such as sleeping, eating, or working (Taken from <a href="http://www.nimh.nih.gov/">www.nimh.nih.gov</a>). This affects people in various negative ways. Depression is also one of the leading causes of suicide. While some are not completely oblivious to their situations, those afflicted with it have a way of thinking that more often than not prevents them from trying to find help, and many times keep it from their family and their friends out of the fear of seeming like a burden to them, and because of the stigma our country has for depression itself.</p>
